Tanzania's incumbent president has been declared reelected with ninety eight % of the vote in an election denounced by the opposition as a sham. The government denies that hundreds of people have been killed in a police crackdown. So, what's behind this crisis and what's next? This is Inside Story. [Music] Hello, welcome to the program. I'm Adrien Finnean. Tanzania's government is denying reports of hundreds of people being killed in the wake of Wednesday's disputed general election. IncumbentPresident Samir Saluhu Hassan has been declared winner with ninety eight % of the vote in the country of nearly seventy million people. She was up against candidates from smaller parties after her main opponent from the Chadma opposition party was charged with treason. Her governing CCM party has run Tanzania since Nineteen seventy-seven under six presidents. It was founded by Julius Snereri who led the country to independence in the Nineteen sixty after British colonial rule. A spokesman for UN Secretary General Antonio Guteres says that he's deeply concerned about thesituation in Tanzania. So what are the implications of the past few days events? We'll get to our guests in just a moment, but first a report from Alexandra Buyers. >> Tanzania's electoral commission has made it official. Incumbent President Samya Saluhu Hassan is the winner of Wednesday's general election, securing another five-year term with nearly ninety eight % of the vote. There was calm in the capital as she cast her ballot. But beyond those walls, the country's seen widespread unrest.From its northern border with Kenya to the southern crossing into Malawi, police have been struggling to contain days of violent protests. Demonstrators are denouncing the vote and calling for the president to step down. Hassan ran virtually unopposed. Her strongest challenger, Tundu Lissu, is in jail on trial for treason, which he denies, and most of the officials of his party, Chadma, are in hiding. They say the vote was a sham and are claiming at least seven hundreds people have been killed in the crackdown.>> I think the number could even be higher. The police are shooting aiming at demonstrators and in fact the response from the government is emboldening the demonstrators. >> The foreign minister spoke to Alazer on Friday and denied the accusations saying security forces have not used excessive force. Whatever means of force that has been used is just uh the the level of protecting force not none of the excessive force has been used. Some of the government properties and offices have been burnt. Some of the governmentcars as well. So I have not seen this seven hundreds anywhere in the United Republic of Tanzania because most of these properties which were affected were public owned properties rather than uh private individuals. [Music] Restrictions on independent monitors and a nationwide internet shutdown have made it difficult to verify information. >> Redible reports we have received indicate that at least 10 people were killed in Daraslam, Shinyanga and Morugoro as as the security forces use firearms and tear gas to dispersprotesters. [Music] >> Demonstrations like this are unprecedented in Tanzania. The country's been governed by the CCM party for nearly half a century, >> but the opposition has been getting louder, saying previous elections were rigged and calling for electoral reforms, which never happened. Instead, rights groups say years of repression worsened in recent months. They say dozens of people have been arrested, killed, or disappeared. The government says it's committed to a democratic process, but internationalobservers fear more unrest could follow. Alexander buyers, Al Jazer for inside story. Let's bring in our guests from Dar Salam. We're joined by Tito Magotti, an independent human rights lawyer and activist who was jailed in Tanzania during former President John Magafouli's leadership. From Nairobi, we're joined by Nicodemus Mind, a researcher with the East Africa Peace and Security Governance Program at the Institute for Security Studies. And from London, we're joined by Fergus Kell, a research fellowwith the Africa program at Chattam House. Uh we did reach out to the government of Tanzania, but no one was available uh to join us on this program. Gentlemen, a warm welcome to you all. Nicodemus, let's start with uh you. Uh Tanzania has been something of an island of of peace uh compared to other countries in it in its own backyard in its own neighborhood. Uh what on earth has gone wrong? Uh this is the culmination of many years of u um electoral injustices and of course an infringement of humanrights as well as political deterioration especially in the capture of institutions and as your reporter said um prolonged period of CCM rule which has come to symbolize some form of personalization of the politics and of course going into this election virtually unchallenged the CCM party. We see that a majority of the citizens were really disenfranchised, aggravated and of course the violence that is being experienced or the protest that we are seeing is a result of a culmination of long periods of uh political uhrepression which has been long uh coming. >> Tito, what what's your view on on what's gone wrong in Tanzania? What role have arrests and forced disappearances uh intimidation of of opposition uh politicians played in in escalating tension ahead of of last week's election? >> Um thanks a lot. Um yes, much of what Nick said, um people have been burning inside. um beyond a perspective that one would see that this is politics and these are politicians. People have been heavilyaffected by um these major um outbreaks of um abductions, enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, torture um and they they don't seem to to to find a way to breathe. um the grievances, the criminal justice mechanisms are not working in anyone's favor. And if you look at it um from a perspective of governance um the people of Tanzania, of course, we Tanzanians have been disengaged um from the governance of the country. uh from having no voices in the parliament, from having no civil society, uh from havingno credible media that would reflect our voices to then the government going after every critical voice. It made Tanzanians realize that um we are now not in a country, we are rather in a territory governed by a few people. >> Tito, I mean, you're actually there um in the country. How would you describe the mood right now? Okay, we've seen those pictures of of people out on the streets on the streets protesting, but but how widespread is that sense of of dissatisfaction of injustice?>> It is it is countrywide. Um you can locate from the map of the country that it's happening at all in Dallas through the capital city through Moanza towards the north uh to the south and in Bay and Tunduma but also through some um suburbs of the country and small areas like um the areas that bord the country to the south uh the Tunduma area to the north the Sirari to to the to the border that borders Kenya. um it is widespread in that nature and it is an outbreak that apprises from time to time. You'd hearthat people are taking to to the street in the northern part of the country or in the southern part of the country. Every every group is trying to find a way to express displeasure in a way that they find appropriate because for a long time they have not been heard. So it's widespread um and it has affected the country heavily. Um now we're experiencing a a more than 24 hours um internet shutdown after restoration of internet yesterday for a few hours. So the country has gone into darknessagain. Um we cannot communicate um and there's um an imposed lockdown um such that people cannot exercise movement and they cannot access social services. Fergus, it it it's difficult for for us as a news organization to get a a firm grip of what's happening on the ground in Tanzania because of that that internet blackout that that Tito uh was talking about. What are we to make of of the denials by the country's foreign minister that that excessive force has been used? What are we to make of thethe fact that the leader of the opposition was jailed on on treason charges ahead of the election? Could President Samir really have won or been reelected with 98% of the vote? What's your view on all of this? >> Well, I think first and foremost, numbers don't lie in terms of the uh the fundamentals here. And I'm talking about numbers going back to when Tanzania was a one party system. The last election under that system in 1990, um you had 7 million registered voters. And in these this week's elections, thesame figure put by the National Electoral Commission is 37 million voters. So that there's been an increase in the 35 years since of 30 million uh supposed registered voters in Tanzania. But the actual choice available to those voters uh effectively remains the same in terms of the removal of choice, the removal of competition. And so what we what we've seen on election day and in the days since in terms of these widespread protests, it's quite notable that those took started to take place onWednesday on election day itself. And and so they they do to some extent reflect that that absolute lack of realistic choice being given to the Tanzanian people. >> All right. Yet it can't surely be just about that. The the the it's not motivated simply by by the the lack of the removal of choice. Surely >> well a longer there's a longer term issue here as as has been said which is about the constitution in in Tanzania which um which grants enormous power to the to the president to the executive toum to appoint high court judges to appoint the national electoral commission. So we're we're talking here about a a widespread system, a a really entrenched system in Tanzania um that has been in place since independence as your as your report mentioned. So it is it is about the denial of of choice there is about what that means for people's day-to-day lives and and how to the extent that they feel uh they have choice and and dignity. Nicodemus, there have been claims that external actors may have been involvedin the the uh unrest uh in Tanzania. How much credit do you give to those those claims? I mean, what would be the the motivation of any external actors on on whose behalf would they be acting if indeed they're present? This is what I call authoritarian solidarity and u authoritarian solidarity is has been very evident in East Africa for the past um few years where we see some form of the governments of the the main East African countries are supporting each other especially when there are riots orprotests and in whichever case for example we saw in Tanzania where Kenyan and Ugandan activists were arrested and tortured. So, and this again the allegations that uh the Ugandan um military or mercenaries that have um gone into the country really um adds to this equation of what I call authoritarian solidarity where uh this oppressive governments of East Africa are coordinating in some in some form and we can see um the three East African countries of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania have had similar challenges in therecent past and of course the issue of authoritarian grip democracy, democratic backsliding and of course increased repression. Um this actually really is what I can say is uh the adds to this equation of authoritarian solidarity where the support uh from um external actors that could be uh the motivation uh really from a researcher point of view. >> Tito would you agree with that? We were talking there about the the leader of the opposition being being imprisoned. You were imprisoned uh by uh byPresident Magafuli. I mean tell us about your experience if you don't mind. >> Yeah. You know um um I was in jail not alone. I was in jail together with um several other people I always say that were selected or rather got a presidential appointment uh to go spend sometimes in jail because of um our human rights work. Um so from such time until today um what I can relate is that there's um um a congruence of application of similar tactics um including um instrumentalization of justice systems of the legal system uhto suppress critical voices. um jailing of opposition um or human rights defenders, human rights lawyers and journalists um has been widely used in the country um as a mechanism um as an alternative to disappearing a person or extrajudicially kill them. Um so Tundu is is in prison not because he's a criminal but just because President Sulu who thought that that's the only way to contain the opposition. Um a few other opposition um figures have been equally harassed as we speak. Tundisu's vicechairperson um has been um detained um since um since last week um on accounts of um immigration. They they alleged that he was was trying to cross border to Kenya illegally. But then how can someone be detained for a week long because of an immigration question? So um it is an application of um these tactics that the regime think keep resorting to whenever they feel like there's a political pressure. And now you can see Tundisu Tundisu's vision through the protesters that um it wasn'tTundu only who is um has grievances about electoral injustices but rather the citizens themselves which is why the entire electoral exercise that was planned did not materialize. um it did not materialize even I mean until now we wondering where did they get the figures um to justify that there was a actual voting process >> Fergus how much of of of the repression that we've seen this week is a a direct result of President Samya's policies how much of this is is perhaps in inheriteda hangover uh from uh Magafouli Well, I think we have to see now that President Samir has been in power for over 4 years. Uh, and the narrative that blames what we're seeing on the actions of her predecessor, I'm not sure that that fully stands up to scrutiny. I think she deserves to be judged on her own actions since she's taken power. And if we if we look for example at some of the key Magafoula officials that uh were in place over the transition, a lot of those have been sidelined since she cameto power or they've been shuffled in and out of of cabinet. We look now, you know, there's now going to be a new vice president in Tanzania. There will be a new prime minister after both of the previous office holders stepped down. So I think really we have to start looking at President Samir's actions as her own and and not constantly through the the prism of her of her predecessor. Fergus, what does the the the security response tell us about the state's regard for uh civil descent?I think it speaks to insecurity from the executive, from, you know, concern about what criticism uh might might do to challenge what their policies. Uh and and so I think uh it it points there to some vulnerability from the governing elite in in Tanzania, lack of willingness to allow the people to to share their views. Nicodemus uh why has President Samir not delivered on the promises that she made when she was standing for election uh four years ago? I mean has she taken any positive steps in in terms of of of promotingdemocracy in it in its truest sense or has she just proven herself over the far the last four years to be to be just as autocratic as as her predecessor? What we saw is the initial stages of her presidency uh there were reforms. She initiated some reforms which many people uh just summarily say they were cosmetic reforms because they not embedded in any uh legal um legal of framework. And of course, as my colleagues have mentioned, the critical issue that Tanzania uh is facing right now is the need for a new constitution because thecurrent constitution is um old, not only old, but it has it vests a lot of powers to the presidency in what we call the imperial presidency. And of course, most of the social ills and as the grievances are are born out of a very dilapidated or a very old constitution that is completely out of date. And of course these reforms that she initiated including the so-called independent electoral commission were nothing just but uh cosmetic in fact um people call this reform washing in fact you know shebegan but of course the end goal was you know intention to really consolidate through her power. But again one uh striking thing is also the nature in which she has been able to go about party politics uh uh in itself. For example, the ruling party CCM has also slid sle into very uh you know authoritarian tendencies in the the in the manner in which they elect their officials is something out of um out of this world very undemocratic and of course a lot has been questioned in terms of how they even come up withthese leaders. So all this is a culmination of uh her policies and of course you have rightly put it um this is an extension of the previous regime under president Muolio there was a break uh by her coming in um as a stop gap but we saw an increased repression abduction and forced disappearances and democratic backsliding that we have never experienced before in Tanzania. Tito, you you're, as we said, a human rights lawyer. What mechanisms, if any, exist within Tanzania for for for victims ofof of human rights violations? Do do they have any access to to justice at all? >> Um, at least not now. Um, the judiciary is in the pocket of the executive. Um, the National Human Rights Institute is dysfunctional. um hasn't delivered um any fundamental um you know verdict relating to some of these atrocities even though we record um and we report with them we complain with them. So um a new down as Nick and um Kell alluded to a new constitutional framework a reconstitution in the project of building a new Tanzania iswhat will um answer some of these critical questions. Um because think about the number of abductions we have had in the country and enforced disappearances but the the the state keeps denying they they keep saying we we are not we are not involved. Um we have tried for example until late lately to pursue habius copas rate uh to try to compel the authorities to bring the board of um a missing um former ambassador to Cuba Humphrey Poly Poly who was abducted um in Dar Islam 2 months ago but then the court keepssaying you you have not um established enough cause for us to compel them to to bring the body and they keep saying they don't know where um Afrey is and there's so many other cases like that. So the the the confidence of the people in the justice systems um um is gone is quite low. Um um probably with a new constitution with a new um in um governance architecture um governance architecture in terms of um having a functional parliament having functional quasai judicial bodies um having independent policy oversightauthority um will probably um reassure the people that there's a place you can run to. >> Okay, Fergus, I just want to broaden this out for a moment. We're rapidly running out of time, but but just explain to us why Tanzania is so important regionally and internationally. We we were talking with Nicodemus about the fact the fact that that there are allegations that that non-state or or um uh external actors are involved in what's going on uh in Tanzania uh right now. Um how is thegoverning party in the country linked to other anti-colonial movements uh in the region? Well, regionally Tanzania is very significant and it's very proud of its history in the region, particularly in terms of supporting liberation movements um to to get rid of of colonial administrations in in southern Africa. Tanzania also is very is very strategic within in terms of its location across the east and southern Africa as a gateway to internal markets in Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, eastern DRC and and tothe south to to Zambia and Malawi. So it's it's a very significant strategic player in the region. But what we are seeing is that some of those relationships are being tested. So for example, we've we've seen in uh just yesterday a statement from the ruling ANC in South Africa who had sent a delegation to attend the elections in Tanzania and they were unwilling to report uh or congra in a congratulatory tone in the way that we would have uh perhaps expected and in previous elections in Tanzania which I think thatthe absence of that uh speaks a little bit to the the protest the um the protest in Tanzania, the process of the election and and how that's being perceived externally. On the international stage, I think Tanzania also has an increasingly significant role. We're talking about a country of 68 million people. That's projected to double by 2050. Um, so the that would make Tanzania the 15th largest country in in the world by population. And again, bringing that back to what I what I said in my earlier remarks about thethe voting age population and the growth there. Um we can see that these these uh different issues are are really interconnected in terms of the the governance space in Tanzania. >> Nicodemus, where do you see this this going? How much of a role has the internet played in in given that it's young people uh mostly who are demanding change in in Tanzania? How much of a role has the internet played in this? How how do you are these protests going to continue or will they be ultimately ruthlessly suppressed?Well, again uh these protests have gone on even uh in the midst of internet shutdown which again uh showcases the level of grievances. I foresee a situation of continued protest and grievances uh now that the president has been announced. Uh there's a lot of dissatisfaction especially in the number of you know the the percentage of her victory and supposed victory and of course this raises a lot of doubt in terms of uh the voter turnout which again is very questionable. So going forward I foresee a situation ofcontinued uh resentment especially as my colleague Tito has mentioned um we have the opposition leader who is still in prison and many other social ills especially um corruption and economic embezzlement of funds and all that. So all this add to a very serious situation that the president if at all this proceeds as it is uh to deal with. And Tito, um, where do you see see this going? Are you I mean, it sounds like like like Nicodemus there is pretty pessimistic about about what what is set to happen? Do you share that pessimism?>> Definitely. Um, definitely. Um, the people I speak to are determined to express anger um and outrage until such time in their head. Um so even today despite the the internet um shutdown people are still organizing people are still showing out um going out in a way that they find okay um and we receive reports from across the country that um it is going down in be it's going down in going down well elsewhere. So it is the anger that has to be um dissolved. Um and we don't know because the demandsare clear also from the people as um Nika said people want electoral justice. Um we want release of people who are illegally detained. Um we want a new election management system. Um we want a rerun of the election. Um and people are even ambitious um such that President Samir must go because why kill to to retain a political office? Why kill our people to retain a political office? So there's a very uh ambitious milestone that people don't want President Sulu in office. So all these questions, all these ultimatumum has to be resolved and it is until such time when people say very >> All right. Sorry to sort of cut you off very briefly, Fergus. Um I hate asking to people to gaze into a crystal ball, but but I mean you're you're the expert. Where do you see this going? >> I think it's very difficult to to know what is what is going to come in future. A lot will depend on how much this mobilization can be sustained and there are potential upcoming um triggers for for further mobilization. if we thinkabout this the um full swearing in ceremony of of President Samir that is is due to happen at some point over the coming days. Um so again it's it's about how much this mobilization can be sustained what the government response will be. Are there will there be any concessions potentially in the release of some of these political prisoners and how will that be managed in terms of the government being keen to avoid um inciting you know further demonstrations in its in its response. I would expectto see a longerterm process around the constitution, a roadmap, but whether that will um whether that will actually deliver change or not is um is unclear given what we've seen in the last week. >> Okay, many thanks to these gentlemen.
