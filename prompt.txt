### December 2025 Forecast by Monika Rajska — Detailed Summary

### Key Themes and Insights

- **Transition to a Higher Level**: December marks a shift from an old cycle (2025) to a new one (2026), characterized by moving onto a higher "level" of personal and collective development. This involves shedding outdated patterns and preparing for fresh potentials.

- **End of Deep Stagnations**: Processes of deep internal blockages and stops, prevalent in November, are concluding. December should be comparatively lighter and more conducive to forward movement.

- **Emergence of “Non-Continuity” Contents**: Content or skills that were adequate at a previous stage but no longer serve at the new higher level become "non-continuities." These gaps or inadequacies will surface strongly in December, demanding conscious attention and transformation.

- **Analogy of Learning English**: Using foreign language skills as an example, Monika explains how communicative competency may suffice for casual situations but fails at higher demands, creating a barrier that must be overcome to evolve further.

- **Two Halves of December**:
  - **First Half**: Characterized by high energy, action, and excitement. Many activities and tasks will be undertaken with enthusiasm.
  - **Second Half**: More clearly defined demands will arise to address emerging gaps and non-continuities, requiring concrete changes.

- **Balancing Extremes**: Life presents polarities and extremes; the key is not to reject either end but to integrate them into a new, balanced "third point" or spiral—symbolizing fullness and evolutionary progress.

- **Spontaneous Shedding**: Old, irrelevant, or counterproductive elements will naturally fall away, akin to "taking out the trash," enabling space for new growth.

- **Emotional Processing**: Feelings of sadness or emptiness during this transition are normal as one adjusts to new internal realities and external circumstances. These emotional gaps will naturally fill within about three months as new understanding or experiences emerge.

- **Recurring Patterns and Inner Reflection**: Repetitive life issues (e.g., relational conflicts, work challenges) indicate inner dissonances. The resolution lies in introspection—identifying what one rejects internally that manifests as external conflict.

- **Interconnectedness of Personal and Environmental Energies**: Personal healing and shifts influence the environment and vice versa. Others around us reflect our internal states, creating a feedback loop.

- **"Child in Candy Store" Metaphor**: December feels like being overwhelmed by abundant new possibilities and choices, requiring discernment not focused on fixed goals but on following curiosity and inspiration.

- **Shift from a Definite Goal to Direction and Curiosity**: The previous cycle emphasized fixed goals; the new cycle prioritizes openness, exploration, and responsiveness to what sparks genuine interest rather than rigid plans.

- **Two Fundamental Paths**:
  - **Path of Lack (Braku)**: A painful, necessity-driven route involving struggle and survival, characterized by focusing on what is missing.
  - **Path of Fullness (Pełni)**: A voluntary, curiosity-driven path where one consciously engages with growth and resources from a place of abundance and inspiration.

- **Technology and AI Caution**: While technology, including AI, accelerates human development, there is a risk of it dulling natural instincts and fostering complacency, potentially pulling people back into the path of lack rather than fullness.

- **Self-Mastery and Decision-Making**: Emphasizes that the individual is the true master of their reality; external forces do not control one’s life unless one allows it.

- **Body and Health Signals**: Physical illness or health problems often indicate stagnation or blockage in emotional or evolutionary processes. Illness is a manifestation of internal systemic imbalance.

- **Relationship and Financial Issues as Indicators**:
  - Relationship problems highlight areas needing self-love and acceptance.
  - Financial difficulties point to a need to change direction and focus inward rather than external blame.

- **Emotional Stagnation and Disease**: Holding onto negative emotions like fear, rejection, or grief without processing results in energy blockages, potentially manifesting as disease.

- **Need for Daily Creativity and Pleasure**: Recommends dedicating a minimum of 20% of daily time to creative or pleasurable activities to maintain balance and vitality.

- **Collective Energetic Context**: Current global potentials for conflict or war are low; the old cycle has ended, and new potentials are still emerging, expected to become clearer in the second half of December.

- **Holiday Season Reflection**: Christmas and other year-end festivities can distract from inner focus and planning for the new cycle. Monika encourages carving out quiet, reflective time amid the celebrations for personal clarity.
