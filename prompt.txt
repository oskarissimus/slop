Zrób mi wideo po polsku w stylu Krzysztofa Jackowskiego na temat filmu „Zrozum, czym jest Ba Zi - 5 kluczowych pojęć”

hi there my friends before we get into analyzing your Bazi I have a quick question have you ever visited a fortune teller before have you seen them ramble on and on and on and you wonder where did they get their information from could they be making it up could they be pulling answers from the air because they know you don't know much about Bazi therefore for the benefit of both of us I would like to share with you a quick introduction of Bazi in this video I will share with you the 5 most important concepts of Bazi so that you will havesufficient understanding to follow along and have a clearer picture of what I'm explaining when we discuss your Bazi later on so let's get into the first concept that I like to share with you in Bazi and that is Yin Yang so what's Yin Yang? basically two contrasting forms of energy day and night hot and cold a vibrant place versus a quiet place hot and soft strong and weak the man masculine energy and a female feminine energy it can also be character outgoing extrovert and a more reserved introvert a person who talks a lot and a person who's quietso everything in this world can be categorized under these two forms of energy the second concept I like to share with you is the five elements which further categorize energy after Yin Yang so what are they basically we have metal water wood fire and earth elements so everything in this world you can be categorized under one of these elements for instance a knife represents metal energy the water that you drink is of course water energy the fire and the stove they are of fire energy and the wooden table is of wood energythis categorization goes beyond physical objects it includes various part of our lives like time space health and even a person's character let me show you a few examples in terms of health our Chinese ancestors thought of the lungs as a metal element and kidneys as water element direction wise they associate the north with water and the south with fire and so on and so forth with regards to time the summer month is classified as fire energy while winter is of water energy as for character in Chinese Confucianism we talk about REN, YI, LI, ZHI, XINso traits like loyalty they are considered metal energy while the Benevolence is considered a form of wood energy and so on and so forth these are just a few examples it's not possible for me to list everything over here but I'm very sure you get the picture within the 5 elements concept other than this categorization there is another thing to take note of which is the relationship between each of these 5 elements basically they have this Sheng and Ke relationship which in English I like to callthe nurture and curb relationship so what does this nurture and curb relationship means? each element can nurture and give life to another element and it can also curb and control another element for the nurturing example wood can burn and turn into fire and so wood nurtures fire then we have fire nurturing earth why because after it burns out it turns to ash and goes back to the earth and in the earth we have minerals like copper bronze silver and gold these are metals so earth nurtures metal with regards to the curb relationshipmetal can be a knife or an axe that can cut down a tree water can cook and extinguish the blazing fire and fire can melt the heart and solid metal so that's a brief explanation of what nurture and curb relationship is all about within the 5 elements concept there is another thing I think it's necessary to share with you that is HE HUA or combination and analogy for that will be something that we have Learned in school before CHEMISTRY where one element  mixes with another element it transform into another element for examplewhen a certain fire element  encounters another element it may transform into water just like in chemistry hydrogen plus oxygen when you mix them together it becomes water so why do we need to bother about this combination that's because in a Bazi sometimes we might hear people say oh this person has a lot of fire this person has a lot of water but if we look closely when there's a combination the fire might have turned into earth might have turned into water it might have transformed into another elementso there isn't so much fire  as it may seem initially so it's not so easy as just simply looking at the eight characters we need to assess the situation so now why do we need to know about these five elements it's because our Bazi is  simply made up of Yin Yang and the five elements Bazi also known as Si Zhu or  the Four Pillars of Destiny consist of four pillars the year pillar made out of two words or elements the month pillar the day  pillar and the time pillar totaling it with that's why it's called Bazi in a bazi chartthe top row is what we call Tian Gan or the heavenly stems while the bottom row the bottom four words is called Di Zhi or the earthly branches each of these elements has its own representation of the five elements and Yin Yang therefore we can say that your Bazi is a combination of energy comprising Yin Yang and the five elements you might have heard people saying something like this oh my master said that I have a lack of water in my Bazi I have too much fire in my Bazi that kind of statements so basicallywe can use what we have  discussed so far about Yin Yang and the five elements to understand about what they actually mean for instance too much fire means a person is very passionate or very impulsive just like a blazing fire but too much water could suggest that a this person might have a very playful personality so this is just one layer of analyzing Bazi there are many many layers to it analyzing Yin Yang & 5 Elements is just one basic level so some masters might offer solutions to a Bazifor instance if a person has too much fire they might say ah you need to use water to  balance to improve your life to improve the Bazi so they might say ah for career wise you need to go and be a swimmer you need to go to the north  to work the kind of things sometimes it can be very amusing that's a very basic level of analyzing Bazi in fact a very low level therefore I'm gonna introduce you to the concept in this video which is called Shi Shen or the 10 gods which is a higher level of  analyzing a person's Bazibecause analyzing Yin Yang and  the 5 Elements, is not enough these 10 Gods by the way they are not 10 different gods but rather they are 10 Jing Shen in Chinese 10 different attitudes 10 different character traits 10 different spirits in life think of it as 10 different  characters in a TV show or movie each has a unique superpower let me share a few examples here we have the Shi Shen or Eating God as the name suggest it's related to food like a chef people with this 10Gods in their Bazi often have artistic or technical talentsjust like a chef and they are generally fortunate in life enjoying good food regularly another example is that Qi Sha or the 7 kill as the name implies individuals with this 7 kill they have a very powerful aura just like a general or Mafia people naturally will tend to listen to them because they carry a very strong presence I hope you're still here with me as you can see possible is a really complex topic and trust me there's so many other concepts that didn't share because if I did this video will turn into a one week Bazi courseI'm taking this time to share these 5 important concepts with you even though it's an additional step for me as I could have gone straight to talk about your Bazi the reason is because I want to be more responsible than the other Bazi masters out there by taking this time to share  these 5 important concepts it ensures that you as my client will have a better understanding of your Bazi when we discuss about it later on and not only that it helps you to help yourself in the future because you have better knowledgeand clarity about Bazi you don't have to spend money again and again to get your parts analyzed additionally you gain some metaphysics knowledge and wisdom that are passed down from our Chinese ancestors which you can apply to your life if you're interested to learn more about Bazi or to find out more about  the concepts that have shared so far in this video do  check out my YouTube channel where I videos to elaborate more on this concepts that have shared in detail if you feel that you have Learned something and would like to see more of itplease like and subscribe to my channel now back to this video and here's the good news we are more than halfway through and up next I am going to share the two most important concepts of my entire Bazi introduction however if you're feeling tired I suggest that you take a break over here and return later to watch and understand these two concepts the next concept I like to share is Bazi Profiling think of it like western horoscope where Aries have a set of characteristics and Taurus tends to behave in a certain way Pisces are dreamythat kind of profiling so emphasize it we have such profiling as well in fact many layers of it on the most basic level we have the day master profiling where we categorize you under one of the five elements but that's not the profiling that I want to talk about here there is another even higher level of profiling called Ge Ju which is a key profiling that I want to discuss over here see people often engage in profiling based on their experiences societal norms and preconceived notions this tendency is part of how our brains process informationto make sense of the world when someone mentions their profession such as being a doctor or a lawyer all reminds me automatically associate certain qualities  or traits with that rule for example when someone  says that they are a doctor we will instantly think of words like good in school caring and earning big bucks if somebody mentions that they are lawyer we might associate traits like very adequate and uphold justice in Bazi profiling the goal is to identify and understand what profile is this particular personwhat are his or hers characteristics based on the person it's not about labeling whether he's good or bad but rather to understand what are their unique strengths and weaknesses and their potential traits so basically possibly  represents a person's character and that's the saying your character determines your behavior and your behavior determines your destiny so when we analyze your Bazi you have so many different kind of ten gods so many different superpowers and they are basically all your character so in this high level profiling Ge Juwhat we want to know is what is the predominant ten gods why is the predominant superpower that you have in the Bazi by using a set of bazi formula and also a Master's judgment let's take a look at an example over here in this chart this person has got so many  different kind of 10 gods so many different traits he has this seven kill over here and there and he has this Zheng Cai  or direct wealth over here Zheng Guan or direct officer here Pian Cai or what we call indirect wealth here so this person will exhibit all these Ten Gods all these traits but the predominant onethe most prominent trait in this person's Bazi is the Zheng Cai or Direct wealth based on the formula and my judgment so we have the standard ones like the Eating God Profile, Hurting Officer, Direct Wealth, Indirect Wealth Profiles and so on and so forth a total of 10 standard ones additionally there are some special profile types such as Zhuan Wang Ge, the Exclusive Element profile Chong Ge, the Follower profile and Hua Qi Ge, the Element Combination profile however it's important to note thathaving a special profile type in Bazi doesn't necessarily mean it's better remember I said in Bazi profiling we use specific formulas and a master's judgment to categorize Bazi into different profiles so the special profiles are those that don't fit into their usual formulas and they will have different rules on how to improve their Bazi and make their lives better so why is this Bazi key profile or Ge Ju important it's like identifying a dish you need to know what dish is this then you know how it should taste likeand what is lacking in this dish it's like having an Indian fish curry that doesn't taste spicy but very sour and you know there's an issue with this dish however if you do not know that this is an Indian fish curry and you think that this is Thai Tom yum then you might think that sour is normal the important thing is identifying what it is before a master can give the  right advice on solutions and it brings me to the final concept of my Bazi introduction the single most important  concept in the whole of Baziand that is called Yong Shen or English we call it Useful God or the Useful Trait so why is this useful god  or useful trait so important so what if I can identify what dish is this so what if I can identify what profile is this what are the predominant Ten Gods or what are his or hers characteristics in a Bazi what are the five elements we can get very accurate predictions without knowing him without meeting him but is that the whole point of doing a Bazi analysis No! do you want me to sit down and talk about your character for one hourNo! the true value of doing a Bazi analysis is to offer advice is to give solutions on how to improve the Bazi how to improve the person's life and it's not about showcasing how accurate I am as a master in telling your character we need to know whether this dish do we need to put in a little bit more salt to make this dish taste better or do we need to make the plating a little bit more presentable that's the whole essence of Bazi analysis as I mentioned earlier Bazi is also known as the 4 Pillars of Destinywe wanna know which pillar is the most crucial one the most important one if it's damaged the whole structure will collapse and the analogy that I like to share is like in a team who is the star player who is the most important person with this player around the team wins without him the team loses that key player is the Useful God (Useful Trait) in a Bazi analysis the most important analysis is to identify among these words who is the lead actor who is the star player and from there we can give advice and solutions on how to improve a person's lifeby using more of this useful god trait only by knowing which is the useful god then we can have insights into things like whether the profile is good or their life is good or when they might experience periods of good or bad luck in their life etc so we have come to the end of this Bazi introduction where I share with you 5 most important concepts in Bazi let's do a small recap the first concept that I  share with you is Yin Yang the two most basic forms of contrasting energy in this world No. 2 the five elementswhere everything is categorized under one of these elements and the nurture and Curb relationship of these five elements with each other No.3 the Ten Gods got a higher level of understanding what are some of the typical traits of a Bazi No. 4 the Bazi profiling where we try to identify what dish is this Bazi and No. 5 the most important concept in this introduction in the whole of bazi the useful god where we try to identify who is the star player of the team so there you have it a glimpse into some key concepts of Baziand I trust that this video has provided you with some valuable insights into the world of Bazi and you will have a better understanding when we discuss your Bazi later on I'll see you soon
