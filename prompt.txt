Zrób mi wideo po polsku w stylu Elizy Michalik na temat wiadomości od Qamar

Honestly, I am very embarrassed in front of you because I feel like I have become a burden to you with these circumstances we are living through. Every time I say, “It’s over, maybe the war will stop,” it comes back and we are in more trouble than before. We have been out of the area we were in for two weeks because it is very dangerous. My family and I cannot bear to continue being bombed and destroyed indiscriminately in residential areas. Unfortunately, we will be forced to flee again to southern Gaza. I swear to God, I am writing this with tears in my eyes. I am unable to see my sisters, my mother, and my father in this state, not knowing what to do or who to go to. I will do everything I can to cover the cost of transportation and a tent for my family and I to live in.
Unfortunately, the cost of a tent is 2,000 shekels, which is about $650, and transportation from north to south costs 2,500 shekels, which means the cost of transportation is about $770. All together, transportation and a tent for my family comes to about $1,400. I'm embarrassed to make this request, but if you could do anything to help me protect my family from this ordeal we're in, I would be very grateful.

Please don't hold back, because I swear to God we're exhausted.

Your sister, Qamar, from Gaza
