There are following entrypoints to interact with this app
- `uv run slop generate`
- `uv run slop generate-reaction`
- `uv run slop auth-youtube`
- `uv run slop auth-drive`
- `uv run slop upload-youtube`
- `uv run slop upload-drive`
run one of these to test end-to-end

after all changes run end-to end test

its better for app to fail with informative error than silently going to fallback

setings and envs are managed by pydantic_settings

I dont want to have too much env vars created neither cli flags. dont create those unless necesary or asked to

dont use os.getenv, all env vars should go through config.py pydantic settings
