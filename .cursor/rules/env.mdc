There are two entrypoints to interact with this app
- `uv run slop generate`
- `uv run slop generate-reaction`
run one of these to test end-to-end

after all changes run end-to end test

its better for app to fail with informative error than silently going to fallback

setings and envs are managed by pydantic_settings

I dont want to have too much env vars created neither cli flags. dont create those unless necesary or asked to
